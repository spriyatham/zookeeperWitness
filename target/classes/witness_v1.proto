//TODO:
   1. Only respond to requests when you are in follower mode..
        i.e respond to read with version = -1..which informs that witness is not yet ready
   2. Add nodeId to the read and write requests so that the witness only responds to the leader.
      This I feel prevents information leak, as the witness has to serve only the leader..
